Official Documentation for NSConnect Beta

********
::DISCLAIMER::
This is still in beta and will be for a while!!!

many new functions will be added and be upgraded
in the future!

This is just a test-release
********

::Requirements::
Exploit that supports readfile(path) and writefile(path, text)

python 3.7+ installed on ALL players' computers
(unless you compile the py scripts into exes. just make sure their put in the right place)

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
::Part 1 - What is this?::
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

	This is a system used with any exploit that supports Read/Write.
The purpose of this is to be able to semi-bypass fe. You and your
friends will be able to exploit together. This setup brings in the
possibility for two computers to connect and replicate changes in
game. However, at this current level, it will only work on lan.

	This means that if you and your friends are on the same wifi,
then you will be able to use this. All required files are included
here. There will be more scripts released in later distributions.
For now please support this project if you know how to do this stuff.
By all means edit your copy. Use it to create new scripts and
functions. All source files are included in this zip.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
::Part 2 - Instructions::
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

When you extract this zip you should get a folder labeled "NSC"
this is the folder that you need to put in the "Workspace" folder
of your exploit (or wherever the writefile function writes to).

1. Move the "NSC" folder into the workspace.

2. one person should run the NSConnectServer.py, this will host
the connnecion for all other players.

3. *ALL* players need to run the NSConnect.py and type the ip
that is shown on the host console

4. If it said connected, then it is all good and you can minimize
all of the consoles.

5. Load into a roblox game together. Once you are all in, execute
the Setup.lua file in your exploit. In the dev console on roblox,
you should see "Loadin up the bois"

You are done with setup

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
::Part 3 - Test::
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

There are a few pre-installed commands
use the commands in the chat with the
command prefix. default prefix "/"
 - send : "/send [text]" ex: "/send hi"
 - quit : "/quit"
 - execute : "/execute [httpget/getobjects] [http link/rbxassetid] [player name/all/me]"
 ex: "/execute httpget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield/master/source me"
 ex2: "/execute getobjects 123456789 all"

:send will print text to other players' dev consoles
:quit will end NSConnect and quit roblox
:execute will run the given loadstring on given players' game

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
::Part 4 - scripting::
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

list of functions:
 - create, kill, set, execute

You can inject other scripts to the game using these functions.
look at this example.

game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").NSSend:Fire("Messege")

It shows how to send data to other
players using the event. There will be an implementation of a
few basic functions that scriptors can utilize. The main one
being createing parts. 

The structure for creating a part for
everyone else would be
"create:[name].[property]:[value]"
the properties can be extended like so
"create:[name]/[property]:[value]/[property]:[value]/[property]:[value]"
being iterated by '/'

Example:
	"create:block/pos:0,0,0/size:10,10,10/colorrgb:0,100,100"

the only required property is position other properties will be
defaulted.

to kill someone, for you and your friends. if its one of your
friends, or you, it will work. however, other players, just you
and your friends won't see them.
usage:
	"kill [player name]"
do not get this confused with player object. killing the local
player would be "game.Players.LocalPlayer.Name" not just
"game.Players.LocalPlayer"

Example:
	- "kill demonfall101"

the next function is set
this function will set the linked value for NSConnect to the
following text. This could be useful for scripts as they could
utilize this

Example:
game:GetService('ReplicatedStorage').outcmd.Value.Changed:Connect(function()
	local input = game:GetService('ReplicatedStorage').outcmd.Value
	if string.sub(input, 1, 3) == "msg" then
		local message = string.sub(input, 4, #input)
		print("an idiot said: "..message)
	end
end)

this could be used in scripts to make it listen for something like maybe you
have a messeging gui. You could have it send data with a prefix "msg". then
detect those and use them.

execute is also something that you use on other players. It works just like
the command, except that it is by command line.

usage - "execute [httpget/getobjects] [http link/rbxassetid] [player name/all]"

it will send the link to the connected player with that name. It will run that
script for them. ** Just use code at end of pastebin link, or rbx id num **

Example:
	rbxasset - "execute getobjects 684354876 demonfall101"
	httpget - "execute httpget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield/master/source demonfall101"

Please by all means, edit this program. Take it and use it to
create your own programs and scripts. Add functions. Make it
better. If you change it and make it better. If you would
like to upgrade this. please dm me about it. If i agree to
the changes i will implement it. My personal group's discord
will be the home of this setup. Thank You for testing :)
